# Pig-ETL-Processing
Work based on Cloudera CAP Lab 9 on Oracle Cloud Big Data. Use Pig to explore, correct, and reorder data in files from two different ad networks.  Small samples of this data using Pig in local mode then use ETL scripts to process the complete data sets in HDFS by using Pig in MapReduce mode.
