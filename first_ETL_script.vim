# Edit the code first_etl.pig file to complete the LOAD statement and read the data from the sample you just created.

# Filter out all records where the country field contains USA:

# Used a FOREACH â€¦ GENERATE statement to create a new relation containing the fields in the same order 
# (the country field is not included since all records now have the same value).

# Limit data reordered into limit_reordered and dump.
